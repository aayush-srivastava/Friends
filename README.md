# Friends

This python application demonstrate social media
friend connections using graph data structure.

A simple social media platform can be considered as a graph where 
each user is a node and a friend connection between two users can
be depicted by an egde of the graph.

This program takes a set of users among which some are friends with
each other, the program then works to give a list of friend suggestions
for a particular user based on his current friend list. This suggestions
list is given as an output in the first output that the program generates.

The second output window prints a graph of all the users in the social
media and their friend connections using python's NetworkX and Matplotlib libraries. 

The social media friend graph is defined as an adjacency matrix of all users where each 
friend jconnection is deicted as a 1 and a non connection is depicted as a 0.
